The README explains the analysis files, clear and understandable.

Packages Used:
library(dplyr)
library(data.table)

# Script Functions:
The script included goes through a series simple steps to clean and describe the test data to finish 
with a tidy data set thats easy to read and understand.

1. Each data set of interest is read into read.table
	features
	activity_labels
	person_test	
	data_test	
	labels_test	
	person_train
	data_train
	labels_train

2. features names are taken from features table and attached to the names of data_test/_train
	names()

3. person_test/_train are givin column names "person_code" and activity_labels are givin column names "activity_code"
	names()

4.labels_test/train and person_test/train columns are added to data_test/_train columns using cbind
	cbind()

5. test and training data is combine using rbind
	rbind()

6. forced unique names using make.names ### NOTE: must be used for select() to work
	make.names()

7. Use select() and matches() to find any mean and std measurments as per assignment request
	select()
	matches()
8. arrange() data by activity_code and attach activity_labels proper names in corosponding activity code
	arrange()
	mutate()
9. Substatute less descriptive column descriptions with more reader friendly ones
	names()
	gsub() 

10. Create a "tidy" data frame thats grouped_by person_code and summarized by mean.
	group_by()
	summarise_all()
	NOTE: could only get this to using pipeline and alot of frustration...
	(pipeline) = %>%

11. Last minute add a write.table to write a text file of the "tidy" data to the working directory.
	write.table()

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) 
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 
3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been 
video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, 
where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in 
fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, 
which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body 
acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a 
filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating 
variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
